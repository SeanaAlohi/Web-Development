Project 1

Hello, 

This project is a simple web application that allows the user to sign up, login, logout, and create/delete various notes within their account. I created with app with Python3.12 and installs from pip3. I also used a virtual environment, which I’ve included in this project package. I did follow a tutorial from Tech With Tim on YouTube, but I did follow along and code everything myself. This is evident in the comments I’ve made throughout the code. 

To run the code:
You can open the virtual environment in Terminal (will probably have to download virtualenv)
	cd desktop
	cd notes_app
	source myvenv/bin/activate
Inside the terminal you are using, execute:
	python3 main.py
This should run and create the http request. 


Deadline: I did request an extension from professor RM, so if you have any questions/concerns regarding why I am turning this in a day late, please email me at slanias2@u.rochester.edu or professor RM. 

Thank you!
