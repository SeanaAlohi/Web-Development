This project is a simple web application that allows the user to sign up, login, logout, and create/delete various notes within their account. I created with app with Python3.12 and installs from pip3. I also used a virtual environment, which Iâ€™ve included in this project package.

To run the code:
You can open the virtual environment in Terminal (will probably have to download virtualenv)
	cd desktop
	cd notes_app
	source myvenv/bin/activate
Inside the terminal you are using, execute:
	python3 main.py
This should run and create the http request.
