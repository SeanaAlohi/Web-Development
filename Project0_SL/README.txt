CSC 210: WebProgramming
Project0

For this project, I made a simple portfolio website for the art that I make. I have three different webpages that are linked in the navigation at the top of the website. I included my own imported font. The JS component of my website is the animations on the landing page. I followed a tutorial an imported some js from this link: https://cdnjs.com/libraries/gsap

Please reach out to me if you have any questions or concerns at slanias2@u.rochester.edu.
Thank you!
