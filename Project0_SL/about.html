                <h2> Bio: </h2>
                <p>
                    My name is Seana Marie 'Alohilani Lanias. I was born and raised on the island of Maui. I
                    am currently attending the University of Rochester concentrating in Studio Art. I have been
                    featured in university undergraduate exhibitions in Hartnett Gallery, Asis Gallery, Art and Music
                    Library, and at Rennert's Gallery in Chelsea, NYC. I am a multi-racial woman of Native Hawaiian
                    descent, which is one of the many topics I explore through my art. As an artist, I attempt to
                    showcase my identity and my struggles stemming from this identity through mixed media
                    painting, sculpture, printmaking, and performance.
                </p>

                <h2> Artist Statement: </h2>
                <p>
                    Before taking my first art class in college, I thought an artist was someone who painted
                    or drew realistically and beautifully. But as I progressed I was encouraged to take my art beyond
                    this. I let my mind and body speak by applying paint to the canvas. I later found that I could do
                    this with many mediums at once. I now mostly combine paint, rope, fabric, metal, natural
                    elements, and beading to express the release of tension from my experiences throughout life. I
                    like to explore parts of my identity that have impacted my experience in the world, such as being
                    a woman and a mixed-race Native Hawaiian navigating prejudice in the United States for the
                    first time since leaving Hawai'i.
